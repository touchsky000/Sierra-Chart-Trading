# Sierra-Chart---Google-Sheets-Trading-Journal
Hi everyone,  I just wanted to share with you a Trading Journal for Sierra Chart, since the ones I found online (excel and website) never work, at least with me, I decided to make one. If you want to improve it, I'll be happy to see what you did!

The Python script is to takes all the necessary Values into a CSV file at "C:\SierraBacktest\SavedTradeActivity\Journal.csv", you'll need to change this path to a path of your choice with a blank CSV File.
After that you just have to copy/paste the values into the Trading Journal. 
(PS: I know I could probably do it with fewer lines, but I'm not a python expert and it works so for now it's fine with me. But feel free to show me how to optimize it if you wish.) 

For now the Trading Journal is not fully complete since I only have 1 week of Trading History, but I'll update it over time. 
Don't hesitate to complete it according to your needs, it is very simple.
